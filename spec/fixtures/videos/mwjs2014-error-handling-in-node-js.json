A big issue my team has run into is how to sanely handle errors in node./express. I want to talk about some common (and maybe some less common) ways to handle errors across the stack. We’ll look at patterns for dealing with synchronous and asynchronous errors and talk about when and where they’re appropriate. Mostly this will be about JavaScript, but we’ll touch a bit on logging and other aspects of error handling as well.\r\nLots of code. Lots of real life examples. Should be useful to anyone working with a large team on a large node code base.","post_date":null,"announce_date":null,"host":"youtube","embed_code":"p-2fzgfk9AA","image":"http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/confreaks-tv3/production/videos/images/000/003/236/Jamund_ferguson-original.png?1422383440","views":1031,"views_last_7":3,"views_last_30":5,"license":"cc-by-sa-3.0","attribution":null,"presenters":[{"first_name":"Jamund","last_name":"Ferguson","aka_name":null,"twitter_handle":"xjamundx"}]}
